Other rom tester out on the internet
people created many rom tester and fixer and we tested them at one point to fix our roms but it ended up doing false and positive work and the results was very poor.
the tools made was automated yes but the analysis on roms files was not good it missed out on some or marked bad roms as good when tested it did not work.
there was alot of problems here and there always.


Our software.
emulators on windows has Core DLL for each arcade machine we use that to fix roms up and do other intensive checks to fix it.
we cannot mention the algorythem we use in our tool so others dont copy it.
it is all down to the mind of the creator being so creative and well ahead of all when it comes to creativness.
we put alot of time into this making sure everything is tested and checked and not one rom goes untested.
bad roms are always placed in their own folder the software makes.
